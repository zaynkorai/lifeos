# LifeOS — Pitch Deck

> **"Single Source of Truth for a Human Being"**

## 🎯 The Problem

### App Fatigue is Real (2026)
- Users pay for **10+ fragmented subscriptions**: habits, notes, fitness, finance, calendar
- Apps don't talk to each other — data silos everywhere
- "Productivity tools" add more cognitive load, not less

### The Anti-Distraction Economy
- AI is flooding the world with content
- Focus apps (Freedom, Opal) are surging in paid subscribers
- People are **paying to not use their phones**

---

## 💡 The Solution

### LifeOS: The Central Intelligence Hub

Not another app — **The Operating System for Life**.

We don't just combine apps. We **connect** them to create **Contextual Magic**.

**Example:**
> Poor sleep detected → Deep-work blocks auto-adjusted → Lighter task list suggested → Email drafted to reschedule morning meeting

## 🏛️ The 6 Pillars — "The Perfect 6"

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **1. Focus/Deep Work** | Pomodoro timer + distraction blocking (Forest-style) |
| **2. Agentic Tasks** | AI-powered task management — drafts emails, schedules meetings |
| **3. Habit Gamification** | Lightweight streaks + progress bars (no XP/leaderboards — psychology-backed) |
| **4. Personal Finance** | Envelope budgeting (manual V1, bank API V2) |
| **5. Wellness/Mindfulness** | Journal + mood tracker with AI insights |
| **6. Calendar/Meetings** | Calendar + meeting booking links (Calendly-style) |

### The Neural Engine
> All 6 pillars share a unified AI Data Layer — creating **Contextual Magic**.

**Examples:**
- Workout completed → "Drink Water" auto-marked in Habits → "Protein Shake" added to Budget
- Poor sleep detected → Task list auto-prioritized to 3 items → Deep-work block rescheduled
- 3 days low mood in Journal → Cross-reference habits/sleep → Surface "burnout alert" with recovery plan

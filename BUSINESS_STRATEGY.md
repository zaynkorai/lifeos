## 📊 First Milestone: $10M ARR in 6 Months

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Target ARR** | $10,000,000 |
| **Monthly Revenue (Month 6)** | $833,333 |
| **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** | $25/mo (blended) |
| **Paying Users Needed** | **33,333 users** |
| **at $50/mo (Enterprise)** | 16,667 users |
| **at $20/mo (Pro)** | 41,667 users |

### Reality Check: Growth Trajectory

| Month | MRR Target | Paying Users (at $25 ARPU) | Growth Rate |
|-------|------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Month 1 | $50,000 | 2,000 | Launch |
| Month 2 | $100,000 | 4,000 | 100% |
| Month 3 | $200,000 | 8,000 | 100% |
| Month 4 | $400,000 | 16,000 | 100% |
| Month 5 | $650,000 | 26,000 | 63% |
| Month 6 | $833,333 | 33,333 | 28% |

**This requires doubling every month for 4 months.** Very aggressive, but possible with:
1. Viral loop / referrals
2. Paid acquisition at scale
3. Product-led growth with immediate value

## 💰 Pricing Strategy (Validated by Reddit Research)

### Recommended Tiers

| Tier | Price | Target | Features |
|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **Starter** | $10/mo | Price-sensitive users | Tasks + Calendar sync, NO AI |
| **Pro** | $25/mo | Power users | AI scheduling, time-boxing, focus mode |
| **Team** | $50/user/mo | Small teams | Shared workspaces, team analytics |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Companies 50+ | SSO, admin controls, dedicated support |

### Why This Pricing Works

1. **$10 Starter** — Undercuts Todoist ($5) + Motion ($28). Captures users who want more than Todoist but can't afford Motion.

2. **$25 Pro** — Sweet spot. Cheaper than Superhuman ($30) + Motion ($28), but includes AI. Reddit users say they'd pay $20-25 for "AI that actually schedules."

3. **$50 Team** — Enterprise expansion. Companies expense this without thinking.

### Revenue Mix Target (Month 6)

| Tier | % of Users | Users | MRR |
|------|------------|-------|-----|
| Starter ($10) | 40% | 13,333 | $133,330 |
| Pro ($25) | 45% | 15,000 | $375,000 |
| Team ($50) | 15% | 5,000 | $250,000 |
| **Total** | 100% | 33,333 | **$758,330** |

*Need to hit ~$833K, so push more users to Pro tier.*
